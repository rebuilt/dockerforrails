# README

This is a sample Rails application from Docker for Rails Developers (PragProg).
It was generated using Docker without Ruby installed on the local machine.

We're using the app to discover the wonderful world of Rails with Docker

This is a new line in the file that should not trigger a bundle install
because we've changed the dockerfile to copy all the Gemfiles in a separate command than the rest of the files for the project
